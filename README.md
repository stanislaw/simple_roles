# SimpleRoles

SimpleRoles is a Rails Engine providing simple Role System for any Rails 3 app. 

Initially it was created as demo role-system to accompany [CanTango gem](https://github.com/kristianmandrup/cantango) initial installiation and usage, and intended to be very easy to setup & use.

Now it is good to be used as a real role system inspite of or due to its almost maximum simplicity.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/stanislaw/simple_roles.png)](http://travis-ci.org/stanislaw/simple_roles)

## Installiation

### Prerequisites

* Ruby 1.8.7 or 1.9.3
* Rails 3 or 4
* ActiveRecord with MySQL or SQLite
* ```User``` model in your Rails app.

### It is a Gem

include in Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'simple_roles' 
```

### Set up valid roles you're gonna have in your app and choose a Strategy. 

Create file simple_roles.rb in config/initializers and write in it:

```ruby
# config/initializers/simple_roles.rb
SimpleRoles.configure do |config|
  config.valid_roles = [:user, :admin, :editor]
  config.strategy = :many # Default is :one
end
```

or in a nicer way:

```ruby
# config/initializers/simple_roles.rb
SimpleRoles.configure do
  valid_roles :user, :admin, :editor
  strategy :many # Default is :one
end
```

Now it is time to choose beetween two strategies possible:

* One - each of your users has only one role. It is the most common
  choice for the most of the apps.
* Many - your user can be _:editor_ and _:curator_ and _:instructor_ all
  at the same time. More rare one, setup is slightly more complex.

### One Strategy

One strategy assumes your User model has string-typed 'role' column. Add this to your migrations and run them:

```ruby
class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def up
    create_table(:users) do |t|
      # ...
      t.string :role
    end
  end

  def down
    drop_table :users
  end
end
```

Finally, include 'simple_roles' macros in your User model:

```ruby
class User
  simple_roles
end
```

### Many strategy

In its background 'Many' strategy has following setup, based on <i>has_many :through</i> relations:

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :user_roles
  has_many :roles, :through => :user_roles
end
  
class UserRole < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :role
end

class Role < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :user_roles
  has_many :users, :through => :user_roles
end
```

**You don't need to create these classes (UserRoles, Roles) and write these associations by hands** - all these classes SimpleRoles configures **automatically**. The only class you need is User and you must have *simple_roles* in it (see below).

**But you need** to supply migrations for them - copy and migrate SimpleRoles migrations by following rake task:

```ruby
rake simple_roles:install:migrations
rake db:migrate
```

**Note!** Migrations are based on roles you are to set up as valid (see previous step). If you do not create initializer with valid_roles, then valid_roles will be set up to defaults: :user and :admin.

And finally include 'simple_roles' macros in your User model:

```ruby
class User
  simple_roles
end
```

### Notes

You can skip configuration in initializers and write it the following
way:

```ruby
class User
  simple_roles do
    strategy :one
    valid_roles :user, :editor
  end
end
```

## Usage example

### One

```ruby
user = User.create

user.role # => nil

user.role = :admin
user.role # => :admin
user.admin? # => true
user.is_admin? # => true
user.has_role? :admin # => true
user.has_role? :user # => false
user.has_any_role? :user, :editor, :admin # => true

# Accepts strings too 
user.role = 'instructor'
user.role # => :instructor

# #set_role and #update_role are persistent - #save is called also
user.set_role(:editor)
user.reload
user.role # => :editor

user.update_role(:user)
user.reload
user.role # => :user
```

### Many

```ruby
user = User.new
user.roles # => []

user.roles = :admin
user.roles # => [:admin]
user.roles_list # => [:admin]

user.admin? # => true
user.is_admin? # => true

user.roles = [:admin, :user]
user.roles # => [:admin, :user]
user.is_user? # => true

user.add_role :editor
user.roles # => [:admin, :user, :editor]

user.remove_role :user
user.roles # => [:admin, :editor]
user.has_role?(:admin) # => true
user.has_any_role?(:admin, :blip) # => true
user.has_role?(:blogger) # => false
```

### Both strategies

For each of valid roles both strategies automatically define scope methods in User model:

```ruby
SimpleRoles.config.valid_roles # => [:user, :admin, :editor]

User.users # => []
User.admins # => []
User.editors # => []
```
